⚔️ ##**Codeforge: A Python Learning Adventure**

* *"A forge where adventurers craft their Python skills"*

🛠️ # **Why did I build this?**

Codeforge is an RPG-themed Python learning project designed to make coding a bit more fun (or at least slightly less painful). Instead of just grinding through syntax and logic, I wanted to create a more engaging, structured way to experiment with Python concepts while keeping things lighthearted.

This project started as a fun learning exercise—an exploration of Python programming, code execution security, and project structuring. While not fully deployed (yet), it serves as a foundation for interactive coding challenges and automation tools that might one day evolve into something bigger.

📌 ##**Current State of things**

- Work in progress! 🏗️ Right now, Codeforge is more of a concept than a full-fledged deployed system.
- There’s no server or API integration at this stage—just code, structure, and a bit of organized chaos.
- The sandbox system allows for safe execution of Python code, while the code complexity analyzer is an experimental feature that (loosely) evaluates script complexity.
- One bit I'm still trying to iron out is that the AI gives the code solution far too quickly. The intent is for it to walk you through it in plain english (Ex: "You need to first create an empty list, and then set a counter to 0") 
- I've also posted the test of the instructions that I have used for the bot, I went through dozens of iterations trying to get it to stop giving up the solution unless the user explicitly asks for it - Working on it!
- Everything here is a learning experiment, built through trial, error, and probably more Stack Overflow searches than I'd like to admit.

🧪 Features (So Far)

✅ Sandboxed Code Execution – A (hopefully) safe way to test Python snippets.

✅ Code Complexity Analyzer – Attempts to rank scripts based on arbitrary scoring metrics.

✅ RPG-Themed Learning Experience – Because normal coding is too mainstream.

(Planned expansions include more interactive coding challenges, potential integrations, and maybe even some actual deployment. But one step at a time...)

💡 Why I Built This

 1. To Learn – This is a hands-on project for developing Python skills in a structured way.
 2. To Explore Security Concepts – Writing a safe execution environment was way more challenging than expected, but that’s the point.
 3. To Make Learning More Fun – If I’m going to struggle through debugging, I might as well give it some flavor.

📖 How to Use This Repo

    Check out the sandbox/ folder for the secure Python execution module.
    Look inside analyzer/ for the complexity analysis tool.
    Read the README files inside each folder for more details.
    If you find any bugs… well, congratulations! You’ve unlocked the “QA Tester” achievement. 🏆

📌 Notes & Future Plans

    Yes, this is a work in progress. The plan is to evolve Codeforge over time, adding more automation and interactivity.
    Contributions & feedback welcome! If you have ideas (or just want to nitpick my code), feel free to chime in.
    A full deployment might happen later—once I level up my backend development and AI skills.
