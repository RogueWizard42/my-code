#  Extracting Data from XML

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/xml3.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file. 
-  Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
