    http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt

There are three ways that you might retrieve this web page and look at the response headers:

    Preferred: Modify the socket1.py program to retrieve the above URL and print out the headers and data. Make sure to change the code to retrieve the above URL - the values are different for each URL.
    Open the URL in a web browser with a developer console or FireBug and manually examine the headers that are returned.

# Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file. 
- Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
