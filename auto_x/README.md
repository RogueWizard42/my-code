# auto_x

Welcome to auto_x, a growing collection of automation scripts designed to handle a variety of tasks efficiently. Whether it's parsing files, extracting data, or performing routine system operations, these scripts are built to save time, reduce manual effort, and keep the forces of tedium at bay.
📜 Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for multiple automation projects, each housed in its own subdirectory. Every script is designed to tackle a specific challenge, making it easy to reuse and expand upon them as needed.
📂 Structure

The repo is organized into folders, with each subdirectory representing a separate automation project. Current projects include:

    email_scan - A script that sifts through a text file of email addresses, hunting down the elusive "old" emails like a digital bounty hunter.

More automation tasks will be added as new challenges arise (or when the existing ones get too boring).
⚙️ Usage

Each project comes with its own README.md file containing specific setup instructions, usage details, and any relevant dependencies. Scripts are designed to be run directly from the command line, ensuring simplicity and flexibility.
📜 Contributing

At this time, this is a personal project, but if you're feeling particularly inspired to contribute (or to challenge the existing automation spells), feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
