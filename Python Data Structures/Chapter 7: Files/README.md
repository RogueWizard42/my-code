# This README will cover the assignment requirements for both 7.1 and 7.2

# - I have also uploaded the *.txt files needed to run the programs

# 7.1 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, and print the contents of the file in upper case. Use the file words.txt to produce the output below.
  - **NOTE:** For the words.txt file to work with 7.1 you must have the file in the same directory as the *.py file

# 7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form: 
  <X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475>
  
  -Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution. 
-  **NOTE:** As with 7.1 you will need to have the mbox-short.txt ile in the same directory as the *.py you are using to call it
