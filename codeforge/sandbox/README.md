📜 **Sandbox: The Arcane Art of Safe Code Execution**

   *"Tread carefully, for this forge is enchanted to contain wild spells... I mean, Python scripts."*
    
🛠 **What is the Sandbox?**

The sandbox is a controlled environment for executing Python code safely—or at least, as safely as one can when inviting user input into the equation. The goal here was to create a secure way to test scripts while minimizing the risk of runaway processes, infinite loops, or catastrophic self-destruction (looking at you, rm -rf /).

If this sounds challenging, that’s because it was. Python loves to execute code without asking too many questions, so making it behave responsibly took some effort. But after a lot of trial, error, and repeated pilgrimages to the sacred texts of Stack Overflow, it’s working! 🎉

📌 **Current State**

- 🛠 Fully functional (but always improving!)
- 🔒 Limits what code can do to prevent system-wide chaos.
- 🧑‍💻 Intended for controlled Python script testing.
- 🛡 Security measures in place to block dangerous operations—but let’s be real, no system is ever completely foolproof.

🧪 **Features (So Far)**

- ✅ Executes Python code in an isolated environment
- ✅ Prevents dangerous commands from running (or tries really hard to)
- ✅ Restricts access to system-level functions
- ✅ Gracefully handles errors (as opposed to Python’s usual "welp, good luck" approach)

💡 (Future enhancements include refining security measures and maybe adding custom input validation.)

📖 **How to Use the Sandbox**

- 📂 Check out sandbox_code.py to see the main execution logic.
- 🔍 Read through the security measures—see if you can poke holes in them.
- 📝 Try running safe Python scripts through it (or throw something mildly chaotic at it and watch it not work).
- 🎩 If you break it, let me know—congratulations, you’ve discovered a vulnerability! 🏆

  
 📌 **Notes & Future Plans**

- 🛠 Still tweaking security! Every layer of protection makes it safer, but nothing is ever 100% unbreakable.
- 🛡 Open to feedback & testing—if you find a way to bypass the safeguards, I both appreciate and fear you.
- 🚀 Might integrate this into a larger project later, once I level up my skills in AI and automation.
