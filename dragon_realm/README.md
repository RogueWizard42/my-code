# Dragon Realm Game

## Overview
Dragon Realm is a simple text-based adventure game where the player must choose between two cavesâ€”one containing a friendly dragon who shares treasure, and the other hiding a hungry dragon ready to eat you. The outcome is determined by chance, making each playthrough a gamble of fate!

## Background
I stumbled across the original version of this game online, created by Al Sweigart. I thought it looked like a fun concept and decided to rework it as a personal challenge to see what I could come up with. My version builds on the core idea but adds my own flavor with updated dialogue, an option to flee, and some tweaks to the structure.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script (`dragon_realm.py`).
2. Read the introduction to set the scene.
3. Choose a cave by entering `1` or `2`, or type `3` to flee like a coward.
4. Face your destiny as the dragon reveals its true nature.
5. Decide if you want to play again!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries needed beyond the standard `random`, `time`, and `sys` modules.

## Differences from the Original
- Added a dramatic intro with adventurer-themed narration.
- Included a third option to flee (ending the game).
- Enhanced input validation with error handling for non-numeric inputs.
- Adjusted the encounter text and pacing for a more theatrical feel.
- Made the "play again" loop case-insensitive and more flexible.

## Credits
- Original concept and code by Al Sweigart.
- Reworked and customized by me.

Enjoy the adventure, and may the fates be kind to you!
